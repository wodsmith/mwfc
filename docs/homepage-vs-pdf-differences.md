---

## 1. Championship Dates

**PDF:**
- Specific dates: October 10-11th, 2026
- Location confirmed: Canyon County Event Center

- Generic: "OCT 2026"
- Location: Canyon County Event Center (consistent)

---

## 2. July 11th Throwdown - MAJOR STRUCTURAL CHANGE

### PDF Structure:
**Two separate individual competitions (8 total gym hosts needed):**
1. **Competition A (4 Gym Hosts):**
   - Individual Competition: 4 Divisions (60 Athlete Cap)
   - Men's RX, Men's Intermediate, Women's RX, Women's Intermediate

2. **Competition B (4 Gym Hosts):**
   - Individual Masters 35+ Competition: 4 Divisions (60 Athlete Cap)
   - Masters 35+ Men's RX, Men's Intermediate, Women's RX, Women's Intermediate

- Co-Ed RX, INT, Rookie & Masters 35+ Co-Ed RX, INT, Rookie

### Key Differences:
- **Format:** PDF = Individual competitions, Homepage = Team/Partner competition
- **Divisions:** PDF = 4 divisions each (no Rookie), Homepage = 6 divisions (includes Rookie)
- **Structure:** PDF = Gender-separated individuals, Homepage = Co-Ed teams
- **Host Count:** PDF = 8 hosts needed (4+4), Homepage = 4 hosts implied

---

## 3. July 18th Throwdown - Title Change

**PDF:**
- "Masters Team Competition"
- Divisions: Men's Masters (35+) (M/M) RX, INT, Rookie & Women's Masters (35+) (F/F) RX, INT, Rookie

**Homepage:**
- "Masters Competition" (dropped the word "Team")
- Same divisions

**Action Needed:** Clarify if "Masters Competition" should be "Masters Team Competition"

---

## 4. July 25th Throwdown - Title Change

**PDF:**
- "Team Competition"
- Divisions: Men's (M/M) RX, INT, Rookie & Women's (F/F) RX, INT, Rookie

**Homepage:**
- "Partner Competition"
- Same divisions

**Difference:** "Team" vs "Partner" - implies 2-person teams (partner) rather than larger teams

---

## 5. Team Size Inconsistency

**PDF (Page 6 - Throwdown Description):**
- States: "3-person teams"
- Text: "What's the format? 3-person teams. 1 day. 4 workouts."

**PDF (Page 1 - Division Details):**
- Shows partner divisions: (M/M), (F/F), (M/F)
- Implies 2-person teams

**Homepage:**
- Consistently shows partner (2-person) format: "Teams of 2" (line 381-382)

**Action Needed:** Resolve discrepancy - are throwdowns 2-person or 3-person teams? Homepage appears correct with 2-person format.

---

## 6. Registration Costs

**PDF (Page 2):**
- Individual Registration: $149/Athlete (includes Athlete T-Shirts)
- Team Registration: $199/Team (includes Athlete T-Shirts)

  - 60 Teams: $6,000 / $4,500 (Sold Out)

**Homepage (lines 651-696):**
- Generic: "50/50 Revenue Share - Make up to $4-6k"
- Less detail on the specific split

**Action Needed:** Homepage is simplified; PDF has detailed financials for host gyms

---

## 8. Qualification Details

### PDF (Page 4) - Specific Numbers:

**Individual Divisions:**
- Online Qualifier: Top 3 Athletes Qualify

**Team Divisions:**
- Online Qualifier: Top 3 Teams Qualify
- Throwdowns: 8 Qualify as 1st Place from in-person Throwdown (8 host gyms)

### Homepage (lines 509-544) - General Description:
- Win your Throwdown - Top team receives direct invite
- Global Leaderboard Top 5 - who didn't win their event

- States individuals MUST do Online Qualifier (it's the ONLY path)
- Teams can do EITHER Online Qualifier OR Throwdowns

**Homepage (lines 311-340):**
- Shows this distinction in a highlighted box
- Individual Athletes: "Must compete in the Online Qualifier - this is the ONLY way for individuals to qualify"
- Teams: "Can qualify through either the Online Qualifier OR MWFC Throwdowns"

**Status:** Homepage correctly reflects this key distinction

- "Scaled and Intermediate athletes" (uses "Scaled" term)
- Emphasizes "3-person teams" (inconsistent with division structure)

**Homepage (lines 479-486):**

**Status:** Homepage copy is cleaner and consistent with 2-person format

## Summary of Critical Changes Needed

### High Priority:
1. **July 11th structure** - Decide: Individual competitions (PDF) or Co-Ed team competition (Homepage)?
2. **Championship dates** - Add specific dates: October 10-11th, 2026
3. **Prize money discrepancy** - Resolve $18,500 (PDF) vs $50,000+ (Homepage)
4. **Team size** - Confirm 2-person (homepage/divisions) vs 3-person (PDF page 6)

### Medium Priority:
5. **July 18th/25th titles** - Clarify "Team" vs "Partner" vs "Masters Competition"
6. **Qualification numbers** - Add specific counts (Top 3 from Online, 8 from Throwdowns, Top 5 from Global)
7. **Registration costs** - Decide if these should be on homepage

### Low Priority:
8. **Host gym count** - Consider adding "8 hosts needed" details
9. **Revenue opportunities** - Add booth/sponsorship info for hosts
10. **Movement standards** - Link to detailed division guides

---

## Recommendations

1. **Resolve July 11th format immediately** - This is a fundamental structural difference
2. **Update championship dates** to October 10-11th
3. **Clarify prize pool** - Big discrepancy between $18.5K and $50K+
4. **Standardize terminology** - "Partner" for 2-person, "Team" for larger groups
5. **Consider separate host gym info page** with detailed financials from PDF
6. **Add championship division detail pages** with movement standards from PDF
